From the shadows emerges the Cyberviper, a twisted amalgamation of man and machine, born from the ashes of a failed volunteer. Its body exudes an aura of unbridled anger, every movement emanating deadly intent.

Once an assassin, morality and conscience are now a distant memory to the Cyberviper. It bears the scars of countless battles, with cybernetic enhancements replacing once nimble limbs, now encased in metallic sheaths and adorned with venomous spikes.

Its venom, a wicked creation of the lab's sadistic minds, courses through its cybernetic veins. The toxin is a silent killer, seeping into the victim's bloodstream with insidious efficiency. Its effects are a macabre symphony of agony, as flesh withers and organs convulse in a dance of torment.

A single scratch from the Cyberviper's poisoned blades heralds a gruesome fate. The toxin takes hold, turning the victim's body into a grotesque canvas of suffering. Muscles spasm, bones crack, and veins pulse with sickly hues as life ebbs away, leaving nothing but an agonizing and prolonged death.

Through clenched, venomous fangs, the Cyberviper snarls with dark amusement. "Beware my bite, for within it lies a venomous kiss. A dance with death, an embrace of eternal torment. Embrace the pain, for it shall be your ultimate downfall."

Its voice carries a chilling tone, laced with a sinister intelligence and cruel amusement. The Cyberviper relishes in the chaos it sows, knowing that its venomous touch brings irreversible doom. It moves with a serpentine grace, striking swiftly and ruthlessly, leaving its victims to writhe in the throes of their own demise.

The Cyberviper, a living embodiment of wrath and torment, stalks the corridors with ruthless intent. Driven by anger and the desire to inflict suffering, it becomes an agent of gruesome demise, leaving behind a trail of bodies tainted by its venomous touch.
